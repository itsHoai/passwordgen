Password-Generator Readme
My task for this challenge was to create a random password generator. 
I accomplish this task by listing different array sets for each password criteria first. 
Then i went on setting up the question prompts to be selected to meet those criterias. 
Then i went on setting up functions that would generate a random password base on the "user" aggreement to the prompts that was required.
Once each selection has been made, a random password will generate inside of the textbox.
